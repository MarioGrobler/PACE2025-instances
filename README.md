This repository contains the problem instances for the PACE Challenge 2025.
Currently, we provide a *preliminary* set of 50 instances for the exact track of the [Dominating Set Challenge](http://localhost:4000/2025/ds/).
For both problems. we plan to add a full set of 100 instances for the exact track as well as a full set of 100 instances for the heuristic track by the end of february 2025.
After the final evaluation of all submitted solvers, we will also release the private instances on which the solvers are evaluated.
